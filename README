You need these to run this:
* PyGTK 
* PyEphem
* python-datetime
* python-xdg

Todo:
* Make prettier icons
* Find an alternate sunrise/sunset method to make this lighter
* Find an alternate moon phase method to make this lighter
* Clicking calendar dates to view hours for any date (iffy)
* Clicking calendar dates to view phase for any date, or something that shows the moon phase cycle for a given date (iffy)
* General code cleaning, as this literally just took a few hours to write up
* Port to PyQt?
