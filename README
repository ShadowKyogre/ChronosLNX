You need these to run this:
* PyGTK 
* PyEphem
* python-dateutil (removed for now for cross-platformness)
* python-xdg (now completely optional, as it's only needed to look for the config file)

Todo:
* Find an alternate sunrise/sunset method to make this lighter
* Find an alternate moon phase method to make this lighter
* General code cleaning, as this literally just took a few hours to write up
* Port to PyQt?
